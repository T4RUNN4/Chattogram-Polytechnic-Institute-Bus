<p style="text-align: justify;">So, on my Diploma-in-Engineer on Computer Science & Technolgy curriculam, there was a subject in 4th Semester called Web Design and Development. Under that subject, we as a team was needed to present a website of our own. As a Captain and Lead Developer of our team, me and my team decided to build this project called "Chattogram Polytechnic Institute Bus tracker" which is initially a bus tracker for our campus. Although when we were making this project, there was no bus service in our campus. So our whole project was made based on mockdata.<p>
